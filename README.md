# CC2 Binary Data++
This library for **C++20 and above** provides the API needed to store data found in videogames by **CyberConnect2** and convert them between different formats, such as binary-encoded data and JSON.

For a library of similar interest, check out my [NUCC++](https://github.com/KojoBailey/nucc-cpp-library), which you can use to extract such data from their XFBIN containers!

Supported games & formats (so far):
* *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R* | `asbr`
    * PlayerColorParam | `player_color_param`
        * Binary
        * JSON
